It's a commonly used function in macroeconomics and forecast production.

The most basic form of the equation is as follows:

$Q(L,K) = A \cdot L^{\beta}\cdot K^{\alpha}$

In this formula, Q is the quantity produced from the inputs L and K. L is the amount of labor expended, which is typically expressed in hours. K represents the amount of physical capital input, such as the number of hours for a particular machine, operation, or perhaps factory. A, which appears as a lower case b in some versions of this formula, represents the total factor productivity (TFP) that measures the change in output that isn't the result of the inputs. Typically, this change in TFP is the result of an improvement in efficiency or technology. The Greek characters alpha and beta reflect the output elasticity of the inputs. Output elasticity is the change in the output that results from a change in either labor or physical capital.

For example, if the output elasticity for physical capital (K) is 0.60 and K is increased by 20 percent, then output increases by 3 percent (0.6/0.2). The same is true for the output elasticity of labor: an increase of 10 percent in L with an output elasticity of 0.40 increases the output by 4 percent (0.4/0.1).

If the sum of $b_{n}$ diverges, and  $a_{n} \leq b_{n}$ for all n, then the sum of $a_{n}$ also diverges. The idea with this test is that if each term of one series is smaller than another, then the sum of that series must be smaller.

For example, the series $[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} ]$ is the harmonic, and is known to be divergent. The comparison test can be used to also assert the divergence of the series $[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{n} ]$. As the terms in the prior series will be 1, 1/2, 1/3 .... and the latter will be 2, 1, 2/3... the latter function is larger than the prior at every single value. Because the summation of $[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{2}{n} >  [ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n} ]$, the series $\frac{2}{n}$ must diverge.  "

For a trigonometric function, the length of one complete cycle is called a period. For example, consider the graph of $\sin(x)$. To determine period, any point can be considered the starting point. Starting from $x = 0$, the graph does not begin to repeat itself (e.g. increasing from y = 0) until $x =2\pi$. Thus, the period can be determined by subtracting the x of the ending point from that of the beginning. 
The period is also inversely related to the frequency of a function. While period is the length of a cycle, frequency is the number of repetitions in a span of $2\pi$. Thus, the formula for frequency is $\frac {2\pi}{period}$

That is to say, the function must appear to be going to the same place from both sides of a single point of finterest. The easiest way to determine existence is by comparison to graphs were the limit does not exist. Consider the following examples. (fig. G) In (a), the graph is discontinuous. However, the existence of the limit is not the same as continuity. On all places, the graph of f(x) appears to be a straight line, except at f(a), where there is a removeable discontinuity. Despite this, the $\lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)$ exists, because the graph approaches the same point from oeither side, the empty point. 
Compare this example to (b), where the function ""jumps"" to another value completely. These values do not agree, $\lim_{x \rightarrow a^+} \neq \lim_{x \rightarrow a^-}$, and as such, the limit does not exist. 
For (c), the limit does not exist because of this disagreement as well. This is not simply because the values are going to infinity, but because one side is negative infinity and the other is positive. An example where a limit being infinity exists would be the function of  $\lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{x^2}$

One of the powerful consequences of a function $y=f(x)$ being differentiable at a point $(a, f(a))$ is that, up close, the function $y=f(x)$ is locally linear and looks like its tangent line at that point. In certain circumstances, this allows us to approximate the original function $f$ with a simpler function $L$ that is linear: this can be advantageous when we have limited information about $f$ or when $f$ is computationally or algebraically complicated. We will explore all of these situations in what follows

It is essential to recall that when $f$ is differentiable at $x=a$, the value of $f^{\prime}(a)$ provides the slope of the tangent line to $y=f(x)$ at the point $(a, f(a))$. By knowing both a point on the line and the slope of the line we are thus able to find the equation of the tangent line. "
